# WordPress Express

**UPDATE** This project has been moved into several separate repositories.

I encourage you to check out [wordexpress.io](http://wordexpress.io) for documentation. This is a still a thing!

First, you'll need [WordExpress Server](https://github.com/ramsaylanier/WordExpress-Server). WordExpress Server is a GraphQL server built using [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). This connects to your WordPress database and provides you with an HTTP endpoint that you can send GraphQL queries. WordExpress Server uses [WordExpress Schema](https://github.com/ramsaylanier/WordExpressSchema), which is a GraphQL schema that provides GraphQL types and queries for querying 

Second, you'll need to take a look at a starter kit. I have created a kit for [Vue](https://github.com/ramsaylanier/wordexpress-starter-vue) and for [React](https://github.com/ramsaylanier/wordexpress-starter-react). Fair warning, I've spent much more time developing the Vue starter kit than the React one. The starter kits provide you with everything you'll need to get up and running on the front end.
